# The art of giving and receiving code reviews

## [Alex Hill](../../speaker/TC8EKK/)

Code reviews are an invaluable tool for improving code quality - not just by catching bugs, but also by improving readability, scalability and maintainability of code. But code reviews are challenging to do effectively, for reasons of personal psychology as well as organisational structure and culture. This talk will present tactics for constructive code review drawing on conflict resolution theory and lessons from the software industry, and discuss the particular challenges of applying these in a research setting.
