# Parallel-in-Time integration with PFASST: from prototyping to applications

## [Robert Speck](../../speaker/EVHLBT/)

The efficient use of modern supercomputers has become one of the key challenges in computational science. For the numerical solution of time-dependent processes, time-parallel methods have opened new ways to overcome scaling limits. With the ‚Äúparallel full approximation scheme in space and time‚Äù (PFASST), multiple time-steps can be integrated simultaneously. Since its use within an existing application code is not straightforward and the potential gain is typically uncertain, we will present in this talk our Python prototyping framework pySDC. It allows to rapidly test new ideas and to implement first toy problems more easily. We will also discuss the transition from pySDC to application-specific implementations.
