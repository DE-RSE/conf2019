# Evaluation of the semantic research data management system CaosDB in glaciology

## [Alexander Schlemmer](../../speaker/8DZRHA/)

We evaluate the open source software CaosDB for its employment in glaciological ice-core research at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven. Here, the system is used for the logistical management of up to several kilometres long ice cores which are stored as ice-core sections in a freezer storage facility. We provided a loan work flow to facilitate and control the movement of ice samples during ice-core processing. Furthermore, we integrate data analysis algorithms for various processing procedures on the ice-core samples. The application of our research data management system (RDMS) to ice-core research demonstrates in particular how a flexible RDMS with a semantic data model can efficiently improve collaborative research.
