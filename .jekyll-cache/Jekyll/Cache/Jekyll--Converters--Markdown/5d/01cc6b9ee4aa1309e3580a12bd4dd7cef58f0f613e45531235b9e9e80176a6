<h2 id="derse-run">deRSE Run</h2>
<p>As a warm-up before the conference we invite you to participate in a morning pre-conference run (weather permitting). It is a great way to get some impressions of the beautiful surroundings of the Telegrafenberg. The run is just for fun, there will be no tracking. Everybody can run along. You can choose between a shorter (about 2km) and a longer run (about 8km). Either way, bring your running shoes. 
There will be limited shower options on the Telegrafenberg.</p>

  <li><strong>When?</strong> 04.06.2019 at 9 am.</li>
  <li><strong>Where?</strong> Telegrafenberg, meeting-point: A17, in front of the library entrance.</li>
