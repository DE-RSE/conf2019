<p>For long, autonomous astronomical telescopes have been the dream of all observing astrophysicists. Partly realized in space missions, the era of robotic observatories as now begun even for ground-based facilities, where the variety of (unpredictable) environmental conditions has long impeded success. The AIP is one of the few institutes world-wide to operate 1-m class telescopes in fully autonomous mode. In this talk, I will focus on the software framework developed throughout more than 15 years to pursue this endeavor.</p>
