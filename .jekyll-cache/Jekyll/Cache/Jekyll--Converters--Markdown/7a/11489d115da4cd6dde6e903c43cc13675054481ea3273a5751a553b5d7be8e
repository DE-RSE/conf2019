<p>Continuous integration/delivery (CI/CD) pipelines are easily available: itâ€™s bundled with GitLab, for example. They can be used for various purposes: automatically testing a codebase on every commit, building and deploying a package and many more. Using CI/CD pipelines have greatly improved workflows in a few of my projects. Based on these experiences, I would demonstrate a few use cases for CI/CD pipelines: (a) automated unittesting in a python software project, (b) scheduled integration tests, (c) automatically generating PDF manuscripts from LaTeX source.</p>
