I"Ø<h1 id="derse19---call-for-contributions">deRSE19 - Call for Contributions</h1>

<p>Following the success of the <a href="https://rse.ac.uk/events/past-conferences/">first three international Conferences of Research Software Engineers in the UK</a>, <strong>deRSE19</strong>, the first conference in Germany addressing research software and the people behind it within the German research landscape will be held at the Albert Einstein Science Park in Potsdam on 4-6 June 2019.</p>

<p>The organising committee welcomes submissions for workshops, talks, and posters for the deRSE19 conference, as well as for splinter meetings and birds-of-a-feather (BoF) events. The aim is to reflect the diverse community of research software engineers by seeking input from all levels of experience and across a variety of domains, geographic locations, genders, and ethnicities.</p>

<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>

<ul>
  <li>20 December 2018 - We are open for submissions</li>

  <li>4-6 June 2019 - deRSE19 conference</li>
</ul>

<p>If your submission is accepted, at least one of the authors is expected to attend the conference to present. Please note that conference fees apply at registration.</p>

<h2 id="conference-sessions-themes-and-types-of-contribution">Conference sessions, themes and types of contribution</h2>

<p><strong>deRSE19</strong> has no pre-defined thematic tracks. Instead, sessions will be inductively created
by the programme committee from the submissions. If your submission addresses a
topic that you think is of interest to the community of people involved in
research software, we would love to see it submitted!</p>

<h2 id="who-should-submit">Who should submit?</h2>

<p>We welcome submissions from any and all people who have an interesting take on research software development, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Researchers at any career stage who develop software for research purposes</li>
  <li>Software developers working in a research context, whatever their job title or field</li>
  <li>Funders and decision makers paving the way for sustainable research software with grants and other instruments</li>
  <li>Those interested in advancing the understanding of how best to use and maintain research software, e.g. with respect to openness, reproducibility, sustainability or scalability and performance</li>
  <li>People from any organisation providing tools, platforms or services that benefit research software, such as IT infrastructure providers or computing and data centres.</li>
</ul>

<p>We‚Äôre aiming for a well-balanced programme that includes a wide variety of perspectives to reflect the diversity of the RSE community and its activities. Similar conferences in other countries in the past found that social sciences and humanities were under-represented so we‚Äôd particularly like to encourage speakers from those areas to apply. We are not just looking for seasoned presenters or people who are already well known. Thus, speakers from under-represented backgrounds and at early career stages are highly encouraged to submit a proposal.</p>

<p>We will select talks and workshops through a single-blind review process, i.e., reviewers will see authors‚Äô names and affiliations. This supports software-related submissions better than a double-blind process.</p>

<h2 id="first-time-presenter">First-time presenter?</h2>

<p><strong>We want you to present!</strong> It‚Äôs important that the programme includes people who don‚Äôt normally publish papers, or give talks at academic conferences. We want your voice to be heard as part of the RSE community. We accept contributions in English or German.</p>

<p><strong>It‚Äôs not intimidating!</strong> deRSE19 is about learning from each other in a supportive atmosphere. Your perspective is welcome and needed, and presenting will be a great chance to start a wider discussion of issues you care about.</p>

<p><strong>We can help!</strong> We can offer mentoring and other support with preparing your presentation. Please email us if you require advice or clarification before making a submission. We aim to offer one-on-one mentoring to help successful applicants prepare their talk, poster or workshop. If you would like a mentor to help you just tick the respective box when submitting your proposal.</p>

<h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>

<p>If you have any questions about the conference, or the submission of proposals, please contact the conference organisers at <a href="mailto:konferenz@de-rse.org">konferenz@de-rse.org</a>.</p>

<h2 id="technicalities">Technicalities</h2>

<p>The focus of deRSE19 is on community. Therefore, instead of asking you to submit an academic abstract following a specific structure, submissions to deRSE19 are a bit more free form.</p>

<p>Simply fill out the <a href="https://derse19.uni-jena.de/derse19/cfp">submission form</a>. The form includes a field for the description of your submission (‚Äúabstract‚Äù, <em>750 characters max</em>!) as well as several others, asking you for details about yourself. We elicit this information because we would like to know a little about your background, your perspective, your experience. This will help us to get to know the RSE community in Germany better.</p>

<p>We will accept contributions in English or German.</p>

<h3 id="formats">Formats</h3>

<h4 id="workshops-splinter-meetings-bofs">Workshops, splinter meetings, BoFs</h4>

<p>Workshops are interactive sessions that give attendees the chance to collaborate
on a specific topic. They may take different forms, e.g., as hands-on tutorial,
discussion and <a href="https://www.software.ac.uk/term/speed-blogging">speed-blogging</a>
session, hack session, etc., as well as splinter meetings for special interest groups, and birds-of-a-feather (BoF) events.</p>

<p>Workshops run over a length of either <em>90 or 180 minutes</em>.<br />
Splinter meetings and BoFs run over a length of either <em>30-90 minutes</em>.</p>

<h4 id="talks">Talks</h4>

<p>Talks may have a length of <em>15-30 mins., including time for Q&amp;A and discussion</em>, depending
on the number of talks in the respective session. If your talk is accepted, you
will be notified about the length of the talk by the session chair.</p>

<h4 id="posters">Posters</h4>

<p>Posters are used to present an overview of an idea, a project, a
collaboration, etc. Posters must be in portrait orientation and maximally up to A0 size (max. height: 1189mm; max. width: 841mm). Please be prepared to give a
very short presentation about the contents of your poster in a ‚Äúlightning talk‚Äù. 
This will help attendees of the poster
session identify the posters and people they want to look at and talk to.</p>
