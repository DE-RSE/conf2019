<p>A sponsorship of <strong>deRSE19</strong> is an ideal opportunity to introduce products and
services to the young and growing research software community in Germany, and
to step up as a champion of the German Research Software Engineering community
right from the start.</p>

<p><strong>deRSE19</strong> is the first conference of its kind in Germany. It is modeled after
the three successful conferences that took place in the UK over the last three
years (<a href="https://rse.ac.uk/conf2016">2016</a>, <a href="https://rse.ac.uk/conf2017">2017</a>, <a href="https://rse.ac.uk/conf2018">2018</a>),
at which sponsors had the possibility to present suitable offers and solutions
and products that are relevant for RSEsâ€™ work, and to enter into a dialogue
with RSEs and software development groups in research.</p>

<h2 id="why-sponsor-derse19">Why sponsor deRSE19?</h2>

<p>Together with the community of active RSEs, decision makers and research
funders, sponsors enable us to build and strengthen the RSE community in Germany.</p>

<p>The support of a conference allows sponsors to access a target group which is
essential in the decision-making in terms of usage of tools and services in science
and research.</p>

<p>Sponsors have the opportunity to engage directly with the Germany RSE community and
connect with the international community through cooperations.</p>

<p>Additionally, sponsors help to establish and promote the role of the Research
Software Engineer in Germany and internationally, to convey skills and best practices,
to promote a network and prepare everyone involved for the growing importance of
software for research.</p>

<p>Sponsors also allow for a more heterogeneous and inclusive conference audience by
helping us keep registration fees low through their financial support.</p>

<h2 id="derse19s-audience">deRSE19â€™s audience</h2>

<p>For <strong>deRSE19</strong>, we expect a diverse blend of around 200 RSEs, decision makers,
research funders, research scholars and Early Career Researchers to attend.</p>
