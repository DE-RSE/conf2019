<h2 id="bj√∂rn-ludwig"><a href="../../speaker/GHQAWB/">Bj√∂rn Ludwig</a></h2>

<p>Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt coordinates the joint research project EMPIR 17IND12 ‚ÄúMetrology for the factory of the future‚Äù with 15 partner institutions spread all over Europe working together with around 30 international industry partners on topics around sensor networks in industry 4.0 settings. This involves a lot of collaborative coding in a publicly hosted GitHub repository with a fully enabled CI/CD pipeline.  The talk guides through the whole setup process for the central repository, collecting all the code written in and for the project, configuration of the chosen CI/CD tools and the experiences with implementing associated software development workflows in the context of such a heterogeneous research environment.</p>
