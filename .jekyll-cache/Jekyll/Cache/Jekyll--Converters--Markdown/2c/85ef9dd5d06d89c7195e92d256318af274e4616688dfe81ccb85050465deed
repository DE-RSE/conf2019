<p>Ivo Kabadshow did his Phd in applied mathematics at JÃ¼lich Supercompting Centre (JSC) focusing on
development and algorithmic enhancement of massively-parallel Coulomb solvers like the Fast Multipole method
(FMM). Currently he is working at JSC modernizing a legacy FMM code for todays HPC architectures. One main
goal is to fully port the available legacy FMM code written in Fortran to a modern and flexible C++11 codebase.</p>
