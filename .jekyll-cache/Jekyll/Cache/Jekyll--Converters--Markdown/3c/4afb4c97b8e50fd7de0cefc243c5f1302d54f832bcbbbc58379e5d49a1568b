<p>Documentation, archival and transmission of contemporary dance works and practices raises the question as to how and in what scope digitisation can already happen embedded in the creative process. To reach beyond performance as a seemingly tangible artwork, modes of digital capture must allow for embodied, intangible references and sub-processes to be put into context by practitioners and scholars. Bodies of work are thus being mapped to hyperlocal referential networks, discrete languages and ontological vector spaces. I present my work on mapping these networks and their unstructured artefacts through means of linked data and annotation as a ‚Äúsemantic glue‚Äù to facilitate navigation, inspection and manual as well as automated inference.</p>
