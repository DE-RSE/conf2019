<p>AIRR-seq (Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire sequencing) data is a special subtype of genome sequencing data, which is assumed to be representative of an individualâ€™s immune status and therefore holds large promises for biomedical research. The AIRR Community was founded in 2015 with the goal to foster the exchange of AIRR-seq data by making it FAIR and available under free/open licenses. It is an international group that assembles researchers and practitioners from all disciplines involved in generating, processing and interpreting this data: Biology, informatics, data science, medicine and law. In this talk I will summarize the main lessons we learned in the process of establishing the community and setting and reaching its goals.</p>
