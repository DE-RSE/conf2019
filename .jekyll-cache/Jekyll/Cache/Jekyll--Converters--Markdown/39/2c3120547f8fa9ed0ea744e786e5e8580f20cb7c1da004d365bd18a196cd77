<p>Potsdam does not have its own airport. But since Potsdam is located near Berlin, you can fly to Berlin-Tegel or Berlin-Sch√∂nefeld. Here is a guide on how to get to Potsdam from these airports.</p>

At the station Zoologischer Garten you can change to the regional express RE1 direction Magdeburg or Brandenburg, which runs every 30 minutes and takes about 20 minutes to Potsdam. It is also possible to use the S-Bahn S7 towards Potsdam Hbf, which runs every 10 minutes and takes about 30 minutes to get there. Total travel time about 45 to 55 minutes.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the bus line 109 can already be left at the Charlottenburg train station, from there take the S-Bahn S7 towards Potsdam Hbf. Total travel time about 55 minutes.</p>

<h4 id="via-berlin-sch√∂nefeld">Via Berlin-Sch√∂nefeld</h4>

<h4 id="from-berlin-hbf-to-potsdam-hbf">From Berlin Hbf to Potsdam Hbf</h4>

<p>After arriving in Berlin, change to the upper level of the station. From here the regional express RE1 direction Magdeburg or Brandenburg can be taken from the track 13 or 14 to Potsdam main station, which runs every 30 minutes and needs about 25 minutes to Potsdam.</p>
