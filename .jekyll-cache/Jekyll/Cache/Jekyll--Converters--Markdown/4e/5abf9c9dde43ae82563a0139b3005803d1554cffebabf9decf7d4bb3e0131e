<p>The promise of the super-computing industry has always been that pioneering bleeding-edge technology built for the hyperscale filters down to become mainstream so we all have exciting stories about how the phone in your pocket is as powerful as the worldâ€™s fastest machine from not-so-many years ago. Whilst this is (was?) true for hardware, there are very few scientists whoâ€™ll tell you that software ease of use or accessibility has moved in such leaps and bounds. Moreover, whilst collaboration with others around the globe brings a lot of benefits, other factors like data security and privacy that can frequently â€“ and very suddenly â€“ demand lots of attention. If weâ€™re to keep our pace of scientific discovery going (or even accelerate it), our most pressing task in the computing community is to give working scientists access to the tools &amp; techniques they need in a form thatâ€™s easy to use, secure for their data and scalable to the limits of their ideas â€“ not limited by their laptopâ€™s memory capacity. This means an inherently different approach to what has come before, not just business as usual with more bandwidth.</p>
