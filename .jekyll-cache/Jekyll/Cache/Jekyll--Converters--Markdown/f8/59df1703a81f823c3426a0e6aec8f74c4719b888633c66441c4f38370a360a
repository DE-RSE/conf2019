<p>The FAIR Principles advocate that all scientific resources should be findable (F), accessible (A), interoperable (I) and reusable (R). First formally published in 2016, they quickly had an amazing impact on the eScience community. Interestingly, although not limited to that, so far the attention has mainly been on the application of the FAIR principles to scientific data. Meanwhile the discussion in the eScience community has reached software as the second major ‚Äúingredient‚Äù of computational science: What exactly do the FAIR principles mean for (scientific) software? And how can we as a community support researchers and developers in making their software FAIR? We share first insights and invite deRSE19 participants to join the discussion.</p>
