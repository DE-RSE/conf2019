<h2 id="ruben-sanchez"><a href="../../speaker/KYD9Z3/">Ruben Sanchez</a></h2>

<p>The open-source SU2 suite has grown in just a few years from a small tool for aerodynamic design to a large community of users and developers with an interest in multidisciplinary optimization. Open collaboration in SU2 has boosted the research of a large number of groups across the world, independently of whether they are directly involved in its development or not. As an example, the original 2013 AIAA conference paper has already received more than 250 citations. However, as the code grows and incorporates new features, so do the challenges related to its management, maintenance and code architecture. This talk will discuss the main challenges of open-source governance on a rapidly growing framework like SU2.</p>
