<h2 id="oliver-pohl-andrea-notroff"><a href="../../speaker/9GJ7CZ/">Oliver Pohl, Andrea Notroff</a></h2>

<p>The â€œCensus of Antique Works of Art and Architecture Known in the Renaissanceâ€ is a research database containing cultural heritage information. Currently, we are working towards a reconception of the â€œCensusâ€ and face the following two challenges. First, we know very little about the Census usersâ€™ behavior. Second, it is necessary to steer towards a paradigm shift regarding the software architecture design of the current Census web application. In our talk we would like to present our findings and thoughts about user research in Digital Humanities (esp. focussing on art history) and discuss an approach to modular and sustainable software architecture for object- and image database application in the Digital Humanities.</p>
