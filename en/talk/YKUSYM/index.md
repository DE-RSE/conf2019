# New Approaches towards User Research and Software Architecture in Research Software Engineering: A Humanities Example

## [Oliver Pohl, Andrea Notroff](../../speaker/9GJ7CZ/)

The "Census of Antique Works of Art and Architecture Known in the Renaissance" is a research database containing cultural heritage information. Currently, we are working towards a reconception of the "Census" and face the following two challenges. First, we know very little about the Census users' behavior. Second, it is necessary to steer towards a paradigm shift regarding the software architecture design of the current Census web application. In our talk we would like to present our findings and thoughts about user research in Digital Humanities (esp. focussing on art history) and discuss an approach to modular and sustainable software architecture for object- and image database application in the Digital Humanities.
