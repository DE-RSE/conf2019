# Research Software Network for the Digital Humanities  //  Forschungssoftware-Netzwerk für die digital arbeitende Geistes- und KulturwissenschaftlerInnen

## [Tibor Kálmán](../../speaker/XGFAEE/)

Sustainable operation, maintenance and development of software, which is utilized in various areas of a research infrastructure and used in various disciplines of the digital humanities (DH), is one of the most serious and important challenges faced. In order to align work on research software development with other DH infrastructures and to unify the recommendations for developers and operators of DH research software, the EURISE network was established. EURISE stands for European Research Infrastructure Software Engineers' Network and the purpose of this international collaboration is to harmonize technical recommendations and processes in research software engineering (RSE).
