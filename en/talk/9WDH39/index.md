## [Martin Hammitzsch](../../speaker/3ZD3GB/), [Stephan Janosch](../../speaker/BRP7VQ/)

The SSI conducted yearly RSE surveys in the year 2017 and 2018. The survey was transported to Germany by Martin Hammitzsch and Stephan Janosch. Both surveys received over 300 answers each and deserve a proper analysis. Especially the many questions and their answers gave helpful insight how the German RSE landscape looks like. Includes scary and positive facts.
