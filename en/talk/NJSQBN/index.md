# RSE 2.0

## [Mark Woodbridge](../../speaker/WXZLNN/)

Research Software Engineering is gaining in recognition as both a discipline and a career thanks to established bodies such as the SSI and newer initiatives including deRSE. But what does the future hold as RSE groups mature, research becomes increasing data-driven and the practice of software engineering evolves ever-more rapidly?  This talk considers potentially disruptive developments in technology that RSEs may need to embrace to play a ongoing role in keeping their institutions at the forefront of research: from machine learning and ‚ÄúSoftware 2.0‚Äù to serverless deployments. I hope this will inspire discussion within the community regarding the future of Research Software Engineering and how we prepare ourselves for it.
