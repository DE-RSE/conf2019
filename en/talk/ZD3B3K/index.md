# Keynote: RSEs together - building networks, groups, organisations and careers

## [Alys Brett](../../speaker/FJWC3N/)

RSEs are at the forefront of a cultural change as organisations adjust to the opportunities and challenges of modern, computational research. One RSE can make a big difference to a project but being part of groups and communities of software specialists can empower them to have a greater impact and a more satisfying career. In this talk Alys Brett, the chair of the Society for Research Software Engineering, will share the experience from the UK of building recognition for the RSE role and developing groups, career structures and communities, and now a professional society.
