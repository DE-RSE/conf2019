# Developing for the Cloud - Azure Notebook, DevOps, Cognitive Services, VM and DataBricks

## [Marcus Kunde](../../speaker/WKBCMC/)

In this workshop, Microsoft technology experts will showcase how Azure Notebook - based on Jupyter Notebooks - can be used to kick-start development in a cloud environment. In addition, we will demonstrate building a CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps, integrate AI into your own applications quickly and easily with Cognitive Services, and introduce DataScience VM and Azure DataBricks as a quick way to get into data science.
