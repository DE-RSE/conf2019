# Keynote: Sustainable Research Software – as Code, as Paper, as Book

## [Andreas Zeller](../../speaker/GDV3JX/)

How can I make research software sustainable? Five basic rules from Software Engineering and Open Source development have the biggest effect: Use a repository, build automatically, test extensively, allow for extension, use examples. The biggest breakthrough, however, comes with modern environments such as Jupyter Notebooks, which integrate code, description, examples, and results in one single document. In this talk, I present the basic rules for sustainable software and show using our textbook "Generating Software Tests" ([www.fuzzingbook.org](www.fuzzingbook.org)), how software, documentation, textbook and slides fit in a single comprehensive package.
