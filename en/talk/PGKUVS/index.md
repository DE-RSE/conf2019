# How to build a modern particle based CFD framework for both - Industry and Science

## [Markus Taesch](../../speaker/ERCHDE/), [Sabine Przybilla](../../speaker/SRFTVU/)

Applying fluid flow simulations to problems of industrial scale is a challenging task. To tackle this, an own CFD code based on Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics arose in a research cooperation between universities and industrial partners. In 2017 the spin-off dive solutions GmbH emerged. The software includes the physical treatment of free surface and multiphase flow, adaptive resolution, a non-particle boundary condition and OMP/MPI parallelization for both on and off premise systems. A python wrapping enables scientists to solve their problems on a higher-level interface and encapsulates the algorithms from the users. The talk presents the described constellation, the software framework as well as the challenges within Lagrangian CFD.
