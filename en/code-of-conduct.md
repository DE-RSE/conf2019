# Code of Conduct for deRSE19

The organizers of deRSE19 are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), technology choices, or other group status.

To make clear what is expected, **everyone taking part in deRSE19** — speakers, helpers, organizers, and participants — **is required to conform to the [Berlin Code of Conduct](http://berlincodeofconduct.org/)**. This includes the main conference itself as well as any affiliated events, including social events or informal meetings outside of the conference venue.

The full text of the Code of Conduct can be found at <http://berlincodeofconduct.org/>.

To give a brief overview here, **you are expected to**:

- participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community;
- exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions;
- attempt collaboration before conflict;
- refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech;
- be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

The **following behaviour is unacceptable**:

- intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in our community online, at all related events and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of community business.

Harrassment includes: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, disability; inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images (including presentation slides); inappropriate depictions of violence (including presentation slides); deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

If you **witness** or **are subject to unacceptable behaviour**, please contact one of the conference organizers. You can do so anonymously. The organizers are listed on this website under [Contact](contact).

# Inclusion and Diversity Plan

**Equity**, **inclusion**, and **integrity** are essential values
of the RSE movement. Respect for these values will naturally result
in the full **diversity** of our community being present and visible
at this conference. In this spirit, the organization team has taken
the following measures:

* **Code of conduct** - To remind participants of their individual
  responsibility for a friendly and inclusive atmosphere, we adopted
  the [Berlin Code of Conduct](https://berlincodeofconduct.org/),
  prominently linked on the conference web site.
* **Committee diversity** – Members of the organization committee,
  members of technical committees, and reviewers have been
  recruited such that they are diverse with respect to research
  areas, level of experience, location, type of institution,
  and gender. Committees’ memberships will vary in future conferences.
* **Speaker diversity** – Similarly, speakers and panelists will be
  chosen to represent diverse backgrounds and interests.
* **Travel awards** – In addition to merit, interest to the community,
  and need, decisions about travel awards will consider diversity
  aspects with respect to demographic, institutional and geographic
  background, level of experience and funding situation.
* **Evaluation and tracking** - Feedback regarding conference
  atmosphere, equity, inclusion, integrity, and diversity will
  be collected and evaluated. Results, and registration statistics,
  will be forwarded to the organizers of the next conference for the
  benefit of future tracking, and used to inform diversity reports.
