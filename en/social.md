# Fringe events and networking opportunities

Not only the official deRSE19 day program, but also the fringe events offer shared experiences and the opportunity to network with other participants. Come along to our pre-conference get-together, participate in the deRSE run and join the guided tour across the Telegrafenberg. 

## Get-together
There will be an informal pre-conference get-together (drinks are self-paid) to tune in to deRSE.  

- **When?** 03.06.2019 at 6 pm.
- **Where?** [El Puerto](http://www.elpuerto.de): Lange Br√ºcke 6, 14467 Potsdam.
- Questions? You can [contact](https://www.de-rse.org/en/conf2019/contact.html) our Social Chair (Heidi Seibold).  

## deRSE Run
As a warm-up before the conference we invite you to participate in a morning pre-conference run (weather permitting). It is a great way to get some impressions of the beautiful surroundings of the Telegrafenberg. The run is just for fun, there will be no tracking. Everybody can run along. You can choose between a shorter (about 2km) and a longer run (about 8km). Either way, bring your running shoes. 
There will be limited shower options on the Telegrafenberg. 

- **When?** 04.06.2019 at 9 am. 
- **Where?** Telegrafenberg, meeting-point: A17, in front of the library entrance.
- Interested? Please sign up here: [https://terminplaner4.dfn.de/ViaO6d2l6fN5WHQo](https://terminplaner4.dfn.de/ViaO6d2l6fN5WHQo). Important note for planning purposes: Please let us know in case you change your mind or cannot make it. Thanks. 
- Questions? You can [contact](https://www.de-rse.org/en/conf2019/contact.html) our Social Chair (Kaja Scheliga).  

## Guided tour around the Telegrafenberg
There will be a guided tour (walk) where you get to discover the sights and (hi)stories of the Telegrafenberg. The tour will last approximately 45 minutes, so you will have enough time for lunch and registration before the start of the conference. 

- **When?** 04.06.2019 at 11:30 am. 
- **Where?** Telegrafenberg, meeting-point: In front of House H.
