# Debsankha Manik

I am a theoretical physicist by training. I finished my PhD on dynamics of flow networks a year ago. Currently I am a postdoctoral researcher at Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization, GÃ¶ttingen, Germany. I have been working in collaborative research software development for a few years. I have written software for simulating demand driven transport systems,  as well as the backend for a software stack that serves transportation requests by customers my dispatching minibuses using an on demand ridesharing algorithm.
