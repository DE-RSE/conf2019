# Anton Koch

I am the senior developer for the Motion Bank project at the Mainz University of Applied Sciences, which has been originally initiated by the choreographer William Forsythe in Frankfurt around 2010 to research the digital documentation and transmission of choreographic thinking processes. My original background is in music production and i have been working as a developer for about twenty years in various start-ups and other commercial ventures.
